# grapeshotClone

this is an implementation of something like grapeshot. It basicly understands what a website is about, for example: war, crime etc.
It is written completely in C++. I use curl, nlohmannJson and mysql.
Extensive string manipulation is used to get the html words.
Extensive use of pointers and modern c++ (17) 
optimized code
